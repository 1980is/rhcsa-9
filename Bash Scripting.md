# Bash Scripting

Every bash script is an executable file that runs tasks. Most often shell scripts
are used to automate routine tasks. 

Every shell script starts with the Shebang ``#!`` \
If you are using the Bash shell the Shebang would be ``#!/bin/bash`` \
It's a good practice but not mandatory to use the **.sh** extension for shell script files.
